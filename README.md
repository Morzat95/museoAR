# MuseoAR

MuseoAR is a mobile-ready, AR learning framework that allows to easily create AR activities and presentations with little to none programming background. It sits on top of [ar.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js)  and uses a .JSON file that contains an array of **cards**, these objects are transitions similar to what **slides** are in an ordinary presentation, inside museoAR these transitions can be triggered by **delay** or by user interaction. eg by **click**

### Upcoming!

  - As of now [projectAR](https://gitlab.com/pedrogut/proyectAR) (museoAR's GUI) is being developed, this sister-project will allow point and click creation of AR experiences inside museoAR.
